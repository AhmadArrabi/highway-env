Graduation project code

This work provides the design and implementation of an autonomous parking system utilizing RL methods. The system is designed to manage and control a vehicle to park in a specified parking position. It can be considered an application of a sim-to-real problem, as a trained RL-based model should ultimately be transferred to control the vehicle.

The simulation environment was developed using OpenAi’s ‘gym’ toolkit in conjunction with the ‘PyGame’ library for a graphical interface. The system is to be tested on a prototype of the parking system using NVIDIA’s ‘JetRacer’ robot.

This repo holds all code used during training the RL method, where an openAi gym enviroment is developed
